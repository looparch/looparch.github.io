When rooms in new buildings are made larger, and there are fewer walls in our homes, the need of acoustic elements increases. The human mind is influenced by all our senses and an annoying sound affects our health and subsequently decreases our creativity. To deal with this issue __Offecct__ created Soundwave®, acoustic panels that have been setting new standards on the market since 2002.\n\nWe have been working with acoustics for a long time, and we were the first furniture company to launch designed acoustic wall panels. We constantly work with the development of acoustic products that not only absorb but also efficiently diffuse and block sound in order to create possibilities for the best possible indoor environment, i.e. Sound Balance."}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"publisher":"Loop Architectural Materials","shareImage":"/images/logo.png","siteUrl":"https://looparch.com","title":"Loop Architectural Materials","userTwitter":"@looparch"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/manufacturers/offecct/acoustic-panels/claesson-koivisto-rune-soundwave-village","manufacturer":"Offecct"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2696595895"]}
