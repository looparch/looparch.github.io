1930, when a young Flemming Juncker united his passion for hardwood flooring with a philosophy of sustainable forestry. Until this day, resource optimisation remains deep-rooted in our DNA and we continue to utilise 100% of the forested timber.\n\nJunckers’ hardwood floors are based on the traditions of Danish craftsmanship and design, which ensures unique, durable floors of quality. As the only flooring company on the market, we additionally provide our own produced wood-care products for easy maintenance and renovation."}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"publisher":"Loop Architectural Materials","shareImage":"/images/logo.png","siteUrl":"https://looparch.com","title":"Loop Architectural Materials","userTwitter":"@looparch"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/manufacturers/junckers/2-strip-flooring/junckers-beech-2-strip-hardwood-flooring","manufacturer":"Junckers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2696595895"]}
